On one side, the Transparent Proxy Model uses two contracts. One of them is the Proxy contract, and the other one is the common contract. The UUPS proxy model adds the upgradeability into the "normal" contract.
So, to upgrade a Transparent proxy model, you need the admin address, and other "normal" users cannot interact with the proxy functions. This can be an advantage of it. But it increases the complexity of the contract, and so can lead to breaches if not correctly implemented and tested.

In the UUPS, the "normal" contract will check if the user asking to upgrade has the required permissions. So, it can be easier in terms of admnistrative burden, but, particularly, you don't need to do a call at the proxy level, which costs gas.
